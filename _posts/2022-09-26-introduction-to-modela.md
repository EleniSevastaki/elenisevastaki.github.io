Introduction to Modela machine:

At the fablab we use the: Modela MDX-20 3D milling machine
The instructions below are for copper and paper plates only and not copper to copper or glass. 

There are three important things to prepare in the machine before working with the software:


**TO THE MACHINE**


Command buttons: 
You can swutch on and the machine
You can look at your piece, by bringinf it close to the edge of the machine
You can bring the the drill up and down


Layers of the machine:
There are 4 layers on the plate:


1)Plastic see trough plate (acryllic material)

2)Acrylic plate (white color)

3)Sacrificial layer (that is also made of copper in case we drill to deep)

4)Copper plate

It is important before we use our copper plate to measure it's thikness precisely with the help of a caliper.

You can fasten and unfasten the layers with the screw on the side.

Drill and bits:
At the fablab we use two milling bits
0.4: for the interior and details
0.8: to cut the final product out

You take out and adjust the bit as shown below
Attention do not let the bit drop they will break easily, always use you your hand below!!
