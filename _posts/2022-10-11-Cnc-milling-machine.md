**IMPORTANT SAFETY MEASURES**

Materials danger:

We use screws to fasten our material on the sacrificial layer if the screw touches the screw while rotating it will create sparkles and in combination with the wood chips absorbed by the ventilation FIRE will occurr

Wrong dimensions:

When choosing your milling bit you should always use the same measument system for the other components and also in the computer.
At the fablab we use the metric system. 

Bit loose adjustment:

In combination with the above comment, a bit not well fastened can move and rotate or get loose, which will destroy your material but also eventually move on the wrong trajectory.

Speed: 

The bit moves with 18000 rotations per minute and it is very very DANGEROUS, always wear your hair up on a bun, wear safety glasses for any flyouts and er protection when the machine is running.

Space organization:

Even if all the precaustions are taken, there could be dangerous materials in room. Pieces of wood on the way, full bag of the ventilation room,or even cups and liquids arounf the desks. Always evacuate any potential dangerous item before staring with the machine.

**NEVER EVER LEAVE THE MACHINE UNSUPERVISED WHEN IT'S ON**

**MACHINE PREPARATION**

*Preparing your machine*

1)Clean table by vaccumung it in case there are residues from the previous user

*Preparing your material*

2)Measure the thickness of your material with a caliper from different angles

3)Measure your milling of choice again with a caliper

4)Sand the sacrificial layer and check on the side if anything is bulging out.

5) Vacuum again the surface

6) Check your material expecially if it's a recycled one for any screws and abnormalities 

**MILLING BITS** 

collet: is essentially what holds the tool bit in place within the CNC Router and therefore is an integral part of machining

Nut: Collet chuck nuts are threaded fasteners that secure collets to collet chucks

Bit: CNC router bits are the cutting implement at the end of the spindle on a CNC router.

 Flutes: Flutes are the sharp slots that corkscrew upwards along the length of a milling bit. They are responsible for doing the cutting work when the bit is spinning. Bits come with 2, 3, or 4 flutes. A bit with more flutes has more cutting edges and consequently cuts faster and smoother than a bit with fewer flutes.
 
 End of the bit: 
 
 Ball nose
 End mill

Changing the milling bit

Via the software Shopbot, you can control the x, y and z

Go on command

Press-> K

With the arrows you can control the x and y axis
with Page up and Page down you can control the z axis
and with CTRL+ Key (of your choice) you can go quicker

Bring your router close to you and level up the z axis

on the back of the skirt loosen up the Butterfly nut and remove the skirt

Check the direction of the screw

unlock the black wrench from the on switch

position the black wrench under and silver wrench above

Now with with a rotating opposite motion loosen up the screw

dismantle the bit, nut and collet add your new collet and bit

Fasten the the collet in the nut and the bit in the collet
attention do insert the bit deep enough.

Fasten the router with wrenches

Fix the skirt back

**AXES**

Click-> XY
Press ->K
Click-> (Z) Zero
Click Z [2 ] 

For Z axis
Press K
Move axis to clear point with keys
Press-> Z
Safety measures-> OK

press-> space bar to pause
