Welcome to an introdcuction to vinyl cutting!


Let's begin with your design:

Depending on your software of choice make sure to save your file in black and white and the white area is the removable area, hence the black one the design of your final product. Then, save your fil as an **SVG** file. 


In fablab we use the **CAMM-1 GX-24 Roland** vinyl cutter, already connected to the pc.
