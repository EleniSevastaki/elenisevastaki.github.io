An introduction to SMD (Service Mount Device)

**MATERIALS AND TOOLS**

Soldering Iron (35W or less)

Solder wire (recommendation: 60/40 rosin core, 0.031" diameter or less)

Soldering Iron Stand 

Iron tip Cleaner: Brass wire sponge

Small Wire Cutters

Tweezers 

Lamp 

Eye Loop

Heatgun and Desoldering Wick Braid Remover (for mistakes)

**PREPARING THE COMPONENTS**

Plug in your solder 

Lay all the parts in front of you

**START TO SOLDER**

Soldering is done by following these steps:

Clean the solder iron tip by wiping it on brass sponge

Touch the clean solder iron tip to both the lead and the pad and let it heat up everything for about 1 second

Add about 1/8" (about 3mm) of solder under the solder iron tip - the solder should melt and flow nicely around the lead and pad

Keep the solder iron tip on the lead and pad for about another second, until the solder is nicely flowed all around the pad and lead

Lift up the solder iron tip from the pad and lead.

Add one of the legs of the component on top of the lead

Clean up the tip of the solder

Warm up the lead again and keep the component stable until everything merges

Clean your tip again

Start with the rest of legs

Now just by warming up the surface and dropping lead on the legs

You can tell a nice solder connection by these five qualities:

The solder flowed nicely around the pad and lead -- no lumps

The surface of the solder is smooth -- not lumpy

The solder totallycovers the entire pad -- you can't see any bare pad

The solder forms a little mountain -- not flat

There is no solder blob connecting your soldered pad to any other pad

There is a lot of leeway between not enough solder (soldered 
connection is flat, or you can see some bare pad) and too much solder (a huge blob that shorts out to another pad). This is why soldering is easy!

**HOW TO FIX A MISTAKE**

There are 3 ways to collect execive excessive lead back:

1) Heat Gun just to to heat up the area

2) with a solder iron vacuum pump

3) with a desoldering Wick Braid Remover

4) with Liquid Flux

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

This process requires a lot of precision, a good lamp and maybe loop will help you in this job.

To control you components use the tweezers, this will help you with stabilizing the components

Always check with the multimetter if your soldering is successfull
