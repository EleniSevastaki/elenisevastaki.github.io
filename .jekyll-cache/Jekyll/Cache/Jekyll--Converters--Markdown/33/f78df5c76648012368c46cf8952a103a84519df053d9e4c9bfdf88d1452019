I"™<p>Introduction PCBs (Printed Circuit Board)</p>

<p>Chips</p>

<p>Programmer
a device that automatically controls the operation of something in accordance with a prescribed program.</p>

<p>Bootloading
A boot loader, also called a boot manager, is a small program that places the operating system (OS) of a computer into memory.</p>

<p>USB serial</p>

<p>Introduction to Modela machine:</p>

<p>At the fablab we use the: Modela MDX-20 3D milling machine
The instructions below are for copper and paper plates only and not copper to copper or glass.</p>

<p>There are three important things to prepare in the machine before working with the software:</p>

<p><strong>TO THE MACHINE</strong></p>

<p><strong>Command buttons</strong>: 
You can switch on and the machine
You can look at your piece, by bringing it close to the edge of the machine
You can bring the the drill up and down</p>

<p><strong>Layers of the machine</strong>:</p>

<p>There are 4 layers on the plate:</p>

<p>1) Plastic see trough plate (acryllic material)</p>

<p>2) Acrylic plate (white color)</p>

<p>3) Sacrificial layer (that is also made of copper in case we drill to deep)</p>

<p>4) Copper plate</p>

<p><strong>It is important before we use our copper plate to measure itâ€™s thickness precisely with the help of a caliper</strong></p>

<p>You can fasten and unfasten the layers with the screw on the side.</p>

<p>We always position the layers on the left bottom corner</p>

<p><strong>Drill and bits</strong>:</p>

<p>At the fablab we use two milling bits</p>

<p>0.4: for the interior and details</p>

<p>0.8: to cut the final product out</p>

<p>You take out and adjust the bit as shown below</p>

<p>Attention do not let the bit drop they will break easily, always use you your hand below!!</p>

<p><strong>TO THE COMPUTER</strong></p>

<p>As a first note, there is a certain flow on how we mill our design. We always go from interior to exterior and from thinner milling bit to thicker milling bit.</p>

<p>Attention when connecting the computer it shouldnâ€™t be on VIEW mode</p>

<p>open: Terminal</p>

<p>Type: Mods</p>

<p>Press: Enter</p>

<p><strong>In Mods</strong>:</p>

<p>click on the left corner</p>

<p>Click: Programs</p>

<p>Click: Open programs</p>

<p>Machine, Click: MDX mill-&gt; PCB</p>

<p>go to: Websocket serial and click: close socket, close port</p>

<p>go on: next to Websocket pyserial and click: close socket, close port</p>

<p>AND then to Websocket serial and click: open socket, open port</p>

<p>go to Read png and click on: select png and choose your 
IMPORTANT: part to keep White, part to go Black</p>

<p>Set your DPI to 1000</p>

<p>go to Mill raster 2D:
 and then press: Calculate
 it will show you your design or press view to check it out.</p>

<p>go to threshold:
 fill it to 0,5</p>

<p>go to Roland MDX/imodela
 and you can manipulate the x and y axis via the computer and z axis via the machine
 example: if you have already some millings on your plate and you want to finish some of them , you do by adding in x or y some extra numbers to your choice and press: move to origin</p>

<p>under jobsettings:
 fill in cut speed: 4
 jog: 2 (redline path jumping indications)</p>

<p><strong>BACK TO THE MACHINE</strong></p>

<p>you can adjust the z axis by pressing the buttons UP and DOWN, after adgusting it to itâ€™s proper height as shown below, you can adjust the bit: loosen up caterfully with the torx wrench until the bit touches the plate, fasten it again youâ€™re ready to start</p>

<p>Go to: Websocket serial 
Press: send file</p>

<p>when finished do not forget to vacuum the plate</p>

<p><strong>FOR THE OUTLINE</strong></p>

<p>Change the milling bit as decripted above we need a 0.8bit now</p>

<p>Move the mill to the origin and level the z-axis</p>

<p>Select your new file again, again DPI: 1000</p>

<p>Go to: mill raster 2D</p>

<p>Set tool diameter: 0.8</p>

<p>Set cut depth: 0.6mm and max depth the the plates thickness that you calculated in the beginning.</p>

<p>Press : calculate</p>

<p>Press: view and check your file</p>

<p>the rest you can leave them with the same numbers as the previous milling.</p>

<p>Go to: Websoscket serial</p>

<p>Press: send file</p>

<p>Again do not forget to vacuum the plate</p>

<p><strong>TO PAUSE THE PROCESS</strong></p>

<p>go to the machine at the command buttons and press: VIEW</p>

<p><strong>TO STOP THE PROCESS</strong></p>

<p>Press: VIEW</p>

<p>Press: UP and DOWN buttons at the same time</p>

<p>Press: move home and stop</p>

<p><strong>WHEN FINISHED</strong></p>

<p>Press: VIEW</p>

<p>vacuum the area</p>

<p>extract your piece with the spatula carefully not to snap the copper</p>

<p>clean your compartments with tweezers and a scalpel if needed</p>
