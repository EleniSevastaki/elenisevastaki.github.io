I"s<p>A small introduction to electonic components soldering:</p>

<p>Step 01:
These are the tools you will need:
Soldering Iron (35W or less)
Solder wire (recommendation: 60/40 rosin core, 0.031‚Äù diameter or less)
Soldering Iron Stand (a bent wire coat hangar works fine)
cellulose kitchen sponge (not plastic)
small Wire Cutters</p>

<p>Step 02:
Lay out all of the parts in front of you. A complete list of parts is available at: Trippy RGB Waves Kit Bill of Materials.</p>

<p>Step 03:
We will start with resistor R1. The colored bands indicate the value of the resistor.</p>

<p>The colored bands for R1 can be either:</p>

<p>The wires of all resistors should be bent down on both sides of the part, as shown.</p>

<p>Another word for wires that come out of electronic parts is ‚Äúleads‚Äù (pronounced ‚Äúleeds‚Äù).</p>

<p>Step 04:
Push the leads from R1 into the pads for R1 on the PCB.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPCB‚Äù stands for Printed Circuit Board, and is the white board that all of the electronic parts are soldered on to.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPads‚Äù are the metal areas on the PCB, usually with a hole in the middle, where the parts will be soldered into.</p>

<p>NOTE: It does not matter which lead of a resistor goes into which pad. This is because resistors are ‚Äúnon-polarized‚Äù.</p>

<p>Step 05:
After placing R1 through it‚Äôs pads on the PCB, bend its leads outward a little, as shown. This allows the PCB to be turned over without R1 falling out while we solder it in place.</p>

<p>Step 06:</p>

<p>Soldering is done by following these steps:</p>

<p>Clean the solder iron tip by wiping it on the wet sponge
Touch the clean solder iron tip to both the lead and the pad and let it heat up everything for about 1 second
Add about 1/8‚Äù (about 3mm) of solder under the solder iron tip - the solder should melt and flow nicely around the lead and pad
Keep the solder iron tip on the lead and pad for about another second, until the solder is nicely flowed all around the pad and lead
Lift up the solder iron tip from the pad and lead.</p>

<p>Step 07:</p>

<p>You can tell a nice solder connection by these five qualities:
The solder flowed nicely around the pad and lead ‚Äì no lumps
The surface of the solder is smooth ‚Äì not lumpy
The solder totallycovers the entire pad ‚Äì you can‚Äôt see any bare pad
The solder forms a little mountain ‚Äì not flat
There is no solder blob connecting your soldered pad to any other pad
There is a lot of leeway between not enough solder (soldered connection is flat, or you can see some bare pad) and too much solder (a huge blob that shorts out to another pad). This is why soldering is easy!</p>

<p>Step 08:
Clip both of the leads of R1 so that they are somewhat flush with the PCB surface. It is not important that the cut be absolutely flush with the PCB. The main thing is that there is not enough of the lead left over to bend over and short out to another pad.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: when clipping leads, always hold the lead with one hand while clipping with the other. This keeps the lead from flying somewhere unwanted ‚Äì such as into your eye! ‚Äì or shorting out some pads somewhere.</p>

<p>Step 15:
Insert the socket for IC1 (the microcontroller) into its pads.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Notice that there is a notch on the black drawing for IC1 that matches with the notch on the socket - make sure these line up when you insert it into the PCB.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Make sure the pins of the IC1 socket are straight, and slide easily into their 8 pads. These pins bend easily, so if one or more are crooked, gently straighten them with your fingers before inserting the socket into place.</p>

<p>Step 29:
Position the battery holder on the bottom of the PCB as shown so its two leads go into their pads.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Unlike all of the other parts in this kit, this part is inserted into the bottom of the PCB.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: This part is polarized ‚Äì be sure to orient it as shown in the photo.</p>
