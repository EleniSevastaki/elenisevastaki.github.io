<p>An introduction to SMD (Service Mount Device)</p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS AND TOOLS</strong></p>

<p>Soldering Iron (35W or less)</p>

<p>Solder wire (recommendation: 60/40 rosin core, 0.031” diameter or less)</p>

<p>Soldering Iron Stand</p>

<p>Iron tip Cleaner: Brass wire sponge</p>

<p>Small Wire Cutters</p>

<p>Tweezers</p>

<p>Lamp</p>

<p>Eye Loop</p>

<p>Heatgun and Desoldering Wick Braid Remover (for mistakes)</p>

<p><strong>PREPARING THE COMPONENTS</strong></p>

<p><strong>START TO SOLDER</strong></p>

<p>Soldering is done by following these steps:</p>

<p>Clean the solder iron tip by wiping it on brass sponge</p>

<p>Touch the clean solder iron tip to both the lead and the pad and let it heat up everything for about 1 second</p>

<p>Add about 1/8” (about 3mm) of solder under the solder iron tip - the solder should melt and flow nicely around the lead and pad</p>

<p>Keep the solder iron tip on the lead and pad for about another second, until the solder is nicely flowed all around the pad and lead</p>

<p>Lift up the solder iron tip from the pad and lead.</p>

<p>Add one of the legs of the component on top of the lead</p>

<p>Clean up the tip of the solder</p>

<p>Warm up the lead again and keep the component stable until everything merges</p>

<p>Clean your tip again</p>

<p>Start with the rest of legs</p>

<p>Now just by warming up the surface and dropping lead on the legs</p>

<p>You can tell a nice solder connection by these five qualities:
The solder flowed nicely around the pad and lead – no lumps
The surface of the solder is smooth – not lumpy
The solder totallycovers the entire pad – you can’t see any bare pad
The solder forms a little mountain – not flat
There is no solder blob connecting your soldered pad to any other pad
There is a lot of leeway between not enough solder (soldered connection is flat, or you can see some bare pad) and too much solder (a huge blob that shorts out to another pad). This is why soldering is easy!</p>

<p><strong>HOW TO FIX A MISTAKE</strong></p>

<p>There are 3 ways to collect execive excessive lead back:</p>

<p>1) Heat Gun just to to heat up the area</p>

<p>2) with a solder iron vacuum pump</p>

<p>3) with a desoldering Wick Braid Remover</p>

<p>4) with Liquid Flux</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTES</strong></p>

<p>This process requires a lot of precision, a good lamp and maybe loop will help you in this job.</p>

<p>To control you components use the tweezers, this will help them stay in place</p>

<p>Always check with the multimetter if your soldering is successfull</p>
