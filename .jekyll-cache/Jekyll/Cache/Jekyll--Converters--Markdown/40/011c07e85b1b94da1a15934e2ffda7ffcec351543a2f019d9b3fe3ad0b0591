I"#<p><strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY MEASURES</strong></p>

<p>Materials danger:</p>

<p>We use screws to fasten our material on the sacrificial layer if the screw touches the screw while rotating it will create sparkles and in combination with the wood chips absorbed by the ventilation FIRE will occurr</p>

<p>Wrong dimensions:</p>

<p>When choosing your milling bit you should always use the same measument system for the other components and also in the computer.
At the fablab we use the metric system.</p>

<p>Bit loose adjustment:</p>

<p>In combination with the above comment, a bit not well fastened can move and rotate or get loose, which will destroy your material but also eventually move on the wrong trajectory.</p>

<p>Speed:</p>

<p>The bit moves with 18000 rotations per minute and it is very very DANGEROUS, always wear your hair up on a bun, wear safety glasses for any flyouts and er protection when the machine is running.</p>

<p>Space organization:</p>

<p>Even if all the precaustions are taken, there could be dangerous materials in room. Pieces of wood on the way, full bag of the ventilation room,or even cups and liquids arounf the desks. Always evacuate any potential dangerous item before staring with the machine.</p>
