I"£<p><strong>IMPORTANT SAFETY MEASURES</strong></p>

<p>Materials danger:</p>

<p>We use screws to fasten our material on the sacrificial layer if the screw touches the screw while rotating it will create sparkles and in combination with the wood chips absorbed by the ventilation FIRE will occur</p>

<p>Wrong dimensions:</p>

<p>When choosing your milling bit, you should always use the same measument system for the other components and also in the computer.
At the fablab we use the metric system.</p>

<p>Bit loose adjustment:</p>

<p>In combination with the above comment, a bit not well fastened can move and rotate or get loose, which will destroy your material but also eventually move on the wrong trajectory.</p>

<p>Speed:</p>

<p>The bit moves with 18000 rotations per minute and it is very very DANGEROUS, always wear your hair up on a bun, wear safety glasses for any flyouts and wear protection when the machine is running.</p>

<p>Space organization:</p>

<p>Even if all the precaustions are taken, there could be dangerous materials in room. Pieces of wood on the way, full bag in the ventilation room, or even cups and liquids around the desks. Always evacuate any potential dangerous item before starting with the machine.</p>

<p><strong>NEVER EVER LEAVE THE MACHINE UNSUPERVISED WHEN ITâ€™S ON</strong></p>

<p><strong>MACHINE DATA</strong></p>

<p>The fablab is using a Shopbot machine</p>

<p>Shopbot software runs Shopbot CNC tools</p>

<p>VCARVE software provides a powerful but intuitive software solution for creating and cutting parts on a CNC Router. (based on website description)</p>

<p>the maximum dimensions for milling are 1,22m x 2,44m</p>

<p>1) Clean table by vaccuming it in case there are residues from the previous user</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>                   Preparing your material
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>2) Measure the thickness of your material with a caliper from different angles</p>

<p>3) Measure your milling of choice again with a caliper</p>

<p>4) Sand the sacrificial layer and check on the side if anything is bulging out.</p>

<p>5) Vacuum again the surface</p>

<p>6) Check your material expecially if itâ€™s a recycled one for any screws and abnormalities</p>

<p><strong>MILLING BITS</strong></p>

<p>Collet: is essentially what holds the tool bit in place within the CNC Router and therefore is an integral part of machining</p>

<p>Nut: Collet chuck nuts are threaded fasteners that secure collets to collet chucks</p>

<p>Bit: CNC router bits are the cutting implement at the end of the spindle on a CNC router.</p>

<p>(Photo)</p>

<p>Flutes: Flutes are the sharp slots that corkscrew upwards along the length of a milling bit. They are responsible for doing the cutting work when the bit is spinning. Bits come with 2, 3, or 4 flutes. A bit with more flutes has more cutting edges and consequently cuts faster and smoother than a bit with fewer flutes.</p>

<p>End of the bit:</p>

<p>Changing the milling bit:</p>

<p>Via the software Shopbot, you can control the x, y and z</p>

<p>Go on command</p>

<p>Press-&gt; K</p>

<p>With the arrows you can control the x and y axis
with Page up and Page down you can control the z axis
and with CTRL+ Key (of your choice) you can go quicker</p>

<p>Bring your router close to you and level up the z axis</p>

<p>Check the direction of the screw</p>

<p>unlock the black wrench from the on switch</p>

<p>CLICK-&gt;CALCULATE</p>

<p><strong>Shopbot software</strong></p>

<p><strong>Fasten your material</strong></p>

<p>Depending on your material size and thickness you will need to screw your material on the sacrificial layer.</p>

<p>You should always note down the ammount of screws that are on the material to remember to take them ALL out after the carving process.</p>

<p>a) If the material is too small</p>

<p>Secure your material with screws first, then go to Vcarve and create a toolpath for your drilling and another for your design.</p>

<p>(Photo)</p>

<p>B) If the material is big enough</p>

<p>When making your toolpath for your design, add another toolpath for your screws, stop the process and drill your screws and then continue.</p>

<p>Type of screws: we use Woodies a type of screws that do not brake easily for the millings convinience.</p>
