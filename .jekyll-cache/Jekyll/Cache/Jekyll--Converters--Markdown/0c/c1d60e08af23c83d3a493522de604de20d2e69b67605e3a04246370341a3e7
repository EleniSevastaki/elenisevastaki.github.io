<p>If any callibration is needed, ypu can adjust the bed height.</p>

<p>Choose your file and start with printing</p>

<p>Check the forst minutes to see if everything is printing properly</p>

<p>You pause to check what is happening to your model or stop the process instead of waisting any filament and then start all over again</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
