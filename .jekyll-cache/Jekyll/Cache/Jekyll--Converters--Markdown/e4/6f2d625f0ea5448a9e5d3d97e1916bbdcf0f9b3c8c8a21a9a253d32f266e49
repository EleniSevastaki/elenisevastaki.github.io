<p>Welcome to an introdcuction to vinyl cutting!</p>

<p>Let’s begin with your design:</p>

<p>Depending on your software of choice make sure to save your file in black and white and the <strong>white area is the removable area</strong>, hence the black one the design of your final product. Then, save your file as an <strong>SVG</strong> file.</p>

<p>In fablab we use the <strong>CAMM-1 GX-24 Roland</strong> vinyl cutter, that is already connected to the pc which uses <strong>Ubuntu</strong>. Next step is to open <strong>terminal</strong> a text based interface where you can command, manipulate files and execute programs.Start by typing :<strong>cd mods</strong> then <strong>bash mods</strong> and <strong>enter</strong>.</p>

<p>In mods <strong>right click</strong>on the module</p>

<p>click on <strong>open programs</strong></p>

<p>click on <strong>machines</strong> under <strong>GX-GS 24 Vinyl Cutter</strong> press <strong>CUT</strong></p>

<p>Let’s move to the machine now:
Open the machine with the switch on button. Start by adjusting the wheels under the white stripes shown as below:</p>

<p>Choose the roller or piece of your choice go to th back of the machine and put the <strong>handle down</strong> and insert the material from behind under the wheels adjust again the wheels if needed and press the <strong>handle up</strong></p>

<p>Attention!! if you are using a normal vinyl the sticker should face up if your using a thermal sticker the sticker should face down.</p>

<p>Last choose for sheet: roll or piece depending on your sizing</p>

<p>Back to your PC in mods:</p>

<p>select your SVG file</p>

<p>Attention!! again your removable area is the white one
if not you’ll have to fix it as below</p>
