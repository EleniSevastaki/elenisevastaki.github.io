I"è<p>This in an introduction to one of the 3D printers Prusa i3 3MKS used in the fablab.
To begin we start by the the digital product and then we transit to the physical product.</p>

<p>Download Prusa Slicer, (I downloaded the 2.5.0 version but I recommend to check with your 3D printers)</p>

<p>Choose your printers and nozzle</p>

<p>Open you file in Prusa slicer your can drag also the file in an open windows of the software</p>

<p>Choose your Mode: Expert</p>

<p>Scale your model to your preferences</p>

<p>Center your model</p>

<p>For any overhangs you can use the tool: paint-on-support to add extra support in your model</p>

<p>Attention!</p>

<p>Before slicing you must check your filament material</p>

<p>Support : for support enforcers only</p>

<p>The printer that you gonna print with is the one in the description</p>

<p>Press Slice</p>

<p>Export the document to a gcode file</p>

<p>Save it your Sdcard that goes with your printer</p>

<p><strong>Machine instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Start by choosing your filament and cut the edge in a diagonal way for an smooth insert</p>

<p>Insert the filament</p>

<p>Clean the surface with a special wiper and product for the printers</p>

<p>Open the machine</p>

<p>Choose: preheat PLA filament</p>

<p>The machine will start extruding the old filament you will have to clean it up Attention! its burning so better use a tool or an extension</p>

<p>If any callibration is needed, you can adjust the bed height.</p>

<p>Choose your file and start with printing</p>

<p>Check the first minutes to see if everything is printing properly</p>

<p>You pause to check what is happening to your model or stop the process instead of waisting any filament and then start all over again</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
